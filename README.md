# HighSchool-Students-Loan-Prediction-Model
In my second year I was chosen by my GDSC club which is a student club for Google to help educate the university students on the tech industry in general,
technology products and Data science topics.
My focus was data science and I was asked To present a data science model to high school students in order to explain what data science is and give them 
direction to help them if they want to choose this field.
So I did a loan prediction model in order to help them understand in big banks how they make the decision to give a client a loan or not based on a series
of information by predicting from previous clients if they made the full payment or not. I did this using python and sci-kit learn library for machine learning.
Creating a decision tree model with some visualizations from data from kaggle. I did the presentation in front of the students and the Data science master coordinator in USJ
was watching and really impressed by it.
